# MYH Minutes 12.02.14

The aim of this meeting was to organise our publicity efforts for University Mental Health Day.

## University Mental Health Day:
- Josh to email Theo to get copies of Tatiana's poster printed asap, and to ask about designing an image and message to change MYH members' profile pictures to on University Mental Health Day: The current suggestion is to have the spires image with the message "Mental Health Matters to Me", or "Mental Health Matters".
- Everyone to contribute to image design, and to change their profile pictures on the day.
Sam to meet up with Theo over logo design potentially?
- Contact college welfare reps through Charlotte and pidge them the posters to put up in their colleges.
- Put the poster on the website and advertise it on Facebook for people to print and put up.
- Â£100 expenditure on Facebook advertising.
- Sam to contact OxStu to get an ad in there. Perhaps use what Jamie put together for Lincoln before.
- Ask James if we have any testimonials that we could put up on that day.
- Jo to write a summary of MYH achievements to put up on that day.

## Wellbeing Week:
- Produce a short video of us talking about why mental health is important to us and use it to start an online conversation about mental health.
- Order colourful tags (with MYH logo on? Maybe just the spires image?) to give to welfare reps. At each college, the welfare reps are to organise for people to write a mental health message on a tag then to tie the tags to a college landmark. Would ideally like 20-30 at each college. Then we can use the photographs of the college landmarks to raise awareness and promote Wellbeing Week.
- TSK poetry event.
- Fran is looking into Freud's charity event. 
- The aim is for 3 or 4 big events, filled in with speaker events and film screenings.
Could host an event at Rhodes House, even if not IGB. Need to book this asap.
Almost impossible to get Alexander Armstrong for this week. Get Mark Williams?

## IGB:
- Now have a US outreach team at Stanford Uni.
- "Hello Sunday Morning" alcohol abuse campaign founder Chris Raine was at Said Business School and met IGB team.
- Patrick McGorry, a mental health campaigner in Australia, will help to link us to underground mental health groups.
- Jonny Benjamin has sent us a video for IGB.
- Ruby Wax will be here for us to film her at the end of March.

- Sam is checking with Edd about the Alastair Campbell event: MYH was used to encourage him to speak, so MYH members should be able to attend. Sam to get in touch with him to enable all members of the university to attend the event for no fee. This event is soon: Thurs 13th March. If Edd and Sam can't make headway, contact James to speak to the president elect.

- Everyone to look at Sophie's survey.
