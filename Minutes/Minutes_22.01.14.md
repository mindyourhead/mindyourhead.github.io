# MYH Minutes 22.01.14

- Stash: T-shirts and hoodies. Navy blue and white. "Mind Your Head" (on the front for visibility), logo. Nothing else. OUSU stash website. Cost?
- Directory of Services is complete. Publicity. Before then MYH members to look over it: Currently has more info than required.
- Email sent earlier this week: Got some positive responses of similar experiences.
- Rustication entitlement in the process of being changed to full (up to colleges' discretion). Once approved, change should be rallied through JCRs/MCRs. MYH to make colleges aware of the change.
- Want more college events. Event pack to be produced.
- Sophie to pilot survey at Magdalen when finished.
- Team members said they'd like mental health training. Richard recommended Student Minds. Training to include a basic introduction to common mental illnesses and how to talk about mental illness. Issues with talking to people about their own experiences. Identify types of situations and discussions we are likely to have and plan training for that. External training, e.g. Student Minds or Counselling Service peer support training. Rosie would like to come in and give a talk to MYH.
- Charlotte wishes to be informed more about MYH activities in order to be more useful.
- Student Minds conference 7-8 March, St John's College. Encourage MYH attendance and taking up roles of co-conveners and hosts for Student Minds volunteers. Musashi and Sam volunteered to be hosts. Musashi could possibly be a co-convener. People don't know their schedules yet. Josh to send an email.

## University Awareness (Sam and Edd): 

- Alastair Campbell speaker event on mental health in MYH's name at The Union. Difficulty in getting Alexander Armstrong due to CEO of Charlie Waller being in hospital. Push to open the event to anyone since he isn't discussing politics. Technically, Union events are open to anyone for a fee. Could subsidise this (£3?). Or have reserved seats for people who book through MYH.
- Sports Federation testimonial progressing. Could have different themed video testimonials with one theme being "Sports", in order to be relevant to everyone. Working on policy for Sports Fed: Reforms to be introduced midway through next term.

### Wellbeing Week:

- Wellbeing Week committee formed. Use shock factor of number of people affected by mental health. Mobilise people to some place: photographs or marks. Flashmob Broad Street or some other march. Chalk messages on the street (weather permitting, dependent on enough space). Give out MYH balloons (to people who participate?). Box of Celebrations to give out: One or two to each person who talk part.
- Speaker events. Richard has access to a lot of speakers. Sam and Edd have an email template of some sort.
- President of Psych Society wants to do a collaborative event.
- Talk from head of Oxford Mindfulness Centre: Mark Williams? Chris Cullen? Josh has contact details for Mark Williams.
- Poetry slam. Link to Arts weeks. Charity music event: Student bands (and Oxford bands?). Launch night. Imps charity show. Outside event: picnic garden party. Lunchtime events: Lunch and learn (picnics?). One really good education event. One really good awareness pushing event. Want to make a strong impression on people. A film each day in a different auditorium. - A play: At T.S. Elliot Theatre or Magdalen Auditorium. James lives with OUDS president (as well as everyone else useful in Oxford!). Everyone to research possible plays and any drama people they know. There was a recent show in London about Freud. Sam's group to come up with a list of films.
- Event at Freud's, e.g. £10 entry and mental health charities pitch throughout the evening. Customers vote for where their entry fee goes.
Ashmolean event: One Friday per month they have a late night opening. Could have a Talk About mental-health-themed event. Could have different things in each room: poetry event, two scene sketch play, bands.
- MYH to sponsor an event like a concert at the Sheldonian.
- Dates for wellbeing week? May is mental health month in the USA.
- Launch of IGB at end of Wellbeing Week. Stephen Fry and Nicholas Kristof to tweet the launch (because Sam is amazing!). Rhodes House. Video booths on Cornmarket in the week. Build up to IGB launch.
- Some team members will be busy with revision. Others can cover. Student Minds may help.
- Someone from Bipolar UK to speak? Tatiana give a talk. Seb to get involved (invite him to the launch).
- Present the viewpoint that sometimes people with mental illnesses won't behave as expected.

## Online media (James):
- mindyourhead@oxford.org belongs to us. Website done by next Friday, but hopefully by this Sunday. Not Wordpress but should be easy to use.
- James to put up new testimonial with a trigger warning for suicide references. 
- James is happy managing the website etc. He has some responses from people who are currently writing articles, so doesn't feel short of team members.

Sam Hollick message: MYH attend event next Thurs, TSK.

## IGB (Josh): 
- Send out a press release close to the time. Contact Seb's Time to Change contacts for publicity for the launch and IGB.
- Promotional video filmed next week. "Stigma"=to mark someone; hence, writing on skin.
- Messages of support along the lines of "I haven't been there, but I am here for you now," "Are you okay?". Message on Time to Change badge? Messages of hope cause change in messages on the skin of the mentally ill people, e.g. different message, or smudged, or fading. Want messages for a variety of mental illnesses, although have to invoke empathy in the audience. E.g. for paranoia, "I'm afraid of everyone I like." Want person supporting a friend or relative, but don't want to give any message that the mentally ill are a burden to others. Scene of someone in bed panicking and getting a supportive text. Hand shaking and words come out of hand. People can put their hands on the back of the person in a locker room supportively, or line up with messages of support on their backs. Seeking everyone's ideas for promo video.

Gorilla campaign for 6 Feb. Time to Talk day. Put signs above doors in colleges at midnight on the night before. (Sophie is looking into the signs.) James to flood Facebook in the morning. Everyone at MYH to change his/her profile picture to the same Time to Talk Day image.
