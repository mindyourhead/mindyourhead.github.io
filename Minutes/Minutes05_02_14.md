# MYH Minutes 05.02.14

## Wellbeing Week:
3rd Week of Trinity Term. Joint between MYH, Student Minds and OUSU. There is now a Wellbeing Week committee between the three.

Need to select from a lot of ideas. IGB campaign launch on the final night is not possible due to the unavailability of Rhodes House. Perhaps more time would be better: June launch? At what stage of development should the website be at the launch? Could have a video booth/video acquiring event during Wellbeing Week.

Performance evening: Short sketches, poetry reading. A play would be too difficult: It would need to be checked carefully in order for MYH to endorse it.

Speaker event: Alastair Campbell, Thurs 13th March 4-5pm at The Union, with MYH. There is another relevant speaker event: John Forbes Nash Jr., Sat 1st March 3-4pm. Edd is still looking into getting Alexander Armstrong. Would like Alastair Campbell to contribute a video to IGB: Sophie to send him a "Thank you" email, to include other things we'd like him to do.

WomCam whiteboard idea variations: Lots of balloons tied around the Rad Cam with messages on/in them.

Any members interested in being involved with Wellbeing Week should get in touch with Sam and Jamie.



## University Mental Health Awareness Day:
19th February. On this day, push for awareness of MYH. How much of the budget (approx. £6,000) do we wish to spend on this?

It was suggested that we purchase smaller, cheaper items, e.g. pens, pencils, notepads, in the interest of getting the name and website to a large number of people, as opposed to buying better quality items, which people would be more likely to keep, but limiting their distribution to a significantly smaller number, many of whom may already be aware of the campaign. Could purchase bags, and give them to libraries for people to take their books away in? Bicycle seat covers (approx. 60p each: adds up!)? Stress balls? Mugs? (Save these for Wellbeing Week talks/events?) Give balloons or stickers for people to walk around town with? Put lots of balloons/stickers around town. What is it legal to stick stickers on? Ask Tesco to stick one on the door? Can Richard print stickers for us? Huge Facebook push~£50? (Could we target this to people on the University of Oxford network?)

Get a spread in the OxStu or other student newspapers. Edd is good friends with the OxStu editor. OUSU have advertising space we could use.

Put a stock poster on the website for people to print and put up. (Could we use the one Tatiana made?)
Sophie to talk to Theo tomorrow about him making the "Mind Your Head" door signs. £(100 + something) for 500.
Snapchat: Use Snapchat creatively, e.g. funny places where stickers were found, or funny pictures of people next to stickers. Perhaps better on Facebook/Twitter: Snapchat pictures are available for a limited amount of time. Competition of the funniest picture of a person next to a sticker.

MYH mascot--Edd? Competition to require a picture with a sticker and a picture with the mascot. MYH bear? If we had a costume, Sam said he would wear it. Everyone wear a onesie with a MYH sash? Snapchat onesie day? Snapchat a MYH onesie. Give out MYH playdough: Ask people to photograph what was made and post the pictures on Facebook/Twitter etc. Jo volunteered to have writing over her on this day.

IGB video booth on the street?

Jo to ask her friend for a price list for MYH signs. 

Neknomination: A person is filmed downing a drink, then nominates others (by Facebook tagging etc.) to do something in the next two days. We could try a version in which people nominate each other to do welfare or awareness related tasks, after carrying out such a task his/her-self. 

***

James to put a summary of MYH achievements to date on the website. Can put these in a student newspaper ad too.

Sophie's survey: Targeting JCR/MCR presidents and welfare reps first. We need to be careful not to name and shame colleges, but can use the prospect of publishing the data as leverage (compare to university race forum). Can we get more quantitative data to better compare colleges? Separate questions into parts so that people can't avoid questions (i.e. where questions feature a list, e.g. "have you ever 1, 2, 3?") Collate rustication statistics. Does "rustication" including voluntarily taking a break from studies? Suicide statistics aren't known either.
Sophie to pilot the survey at Magdalen when we are happy with the questions. Sophie to put the questions in a Google doc.

It was agreed that of the terms "mental health problems", mental health issues", and "mental illness", "issues" is the least stigmatising and "mental illness" the most.
