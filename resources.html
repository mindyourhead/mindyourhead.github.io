                <h2>Services in Oxford</h2>

                <h4>Your GP</h4>

                <p>If you’re a student at Oxford and you’re worried about your mental wellbeing, you may want to make an appointment with a doctor to discuss it. You should be registered with your college’s practice, but you can re-register with any practice in Oxford if you want to.</p>

                <p>GPs in Oxford tend to have a lot of experience dealing with student mental wellbeing. They make a good port of call, as they have an overview of the different services available across Oxford and they know what the student experience is like. They’ll be able to give you a better understanding of what you’re going through, and tell you what your options are.</p>

                <p>They might recommend adjustments to lifestyle that may help – such as exercise, or sleep – or, if it is needed, they can prescribe medicine. They are bound by strict rules of doctor-patient confidentiality, but if you want them to, they can talk to your tutors on their behalf about your situation.</p>

                <h4>College Nurse</h4>

                <p><a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/students/shw/health/doctors/collegedoctors">http://www.ox.ac.uk/students/shw/health/doctors/collegedoctors</a></p>

                <p>Like your GP, college nurses have a good overview of the resources available and considerable experience of helping students with a range of concerns. College nurses have daily clinics during term-time, and can also speak to tutors on your behalf, as well as offering regular support in times of need.</p>

                <h4>TalkingSpace Oxfordshire</h4>

                <p><a href="http://talkingspaceoxfordshire.org">http://talkingspaceoxfordshire.org</a></p>

                <p>TalkingSpace offers a range of therapies that have been approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for the treatment of common problems such as depression and anxiety. Go to the website to carry out a self-referral.</p>

                <h4>Oxford Mindfulness Centre</h4>

                <p><a href="http://oxfordmindfulness.org">http://oxfordmindfulness.org</a></p>

                <p>Our MBCT courses will be useful for people who suffer from recurrent depression, who find that the stress of their lives is creating chronic unhappiness, exhaustion, anxiety and burn-out, as well as people who wish to develop a mindfulness practice to enhance their lives in a variety of ways.</p>

                <h4>Mindfulness for Oxford University students</h4>

                <p>Mindfulness courses for Oxford University students are held regularly at University colleges. The next classes start in January 2014.
                For further information and booking please contact the College nurses at St Edmund Hall or Merton (Glynis Perry or Catherine Haines) using the email addresses below, and you will be provided with a link to pay online.</p>

                <h4>Oxford University Counselling Service</h4>

                <p><a href="http://ox.ac.uk/students/shw/counselling">http://ox.ac.uk/students/shw/counselling</a></p>

                <p>The university counselling service offers individual counselling, group counselling and workshops. The website has links to self-help resources and advice for those who find themselves supporting someone through a mental health problem.</p>

                <p>If you sign up for counselling, you will be offered an initial one-hour session designed to assess your situation and your needs, and to talk about how you might move forward. This might be all you need, but it is common to have a number of additional sessions. You might then be referred to one of the Service’s group  sessions or workshops.</p>

                <p>The Counselling Service also has a very comprehensive list of self-help resources that can be found <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/students/shw/counselling/self_help/">here</a>.</p>

                <h4>Oxford University Mental Health Mentoring</h4>

                <p><a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/global/wwwoxacuk/localsites/studentgateway/documents/disabilityadvisoryservice/Mentor_information_sheet.pdf">http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/global/wwwoxacuk/localsites/studentgateway/documents/disabilityadvisoryservice/Mentor_information_sheet.pdf</a></p>

                <p>If your mental health problem is long-standing, you may be eligible for mentoring support from the Disability Advisory Service. Mentors can help students to maintain study patterns, and assist with timetabling, goal setting, and managing self-imposed expectation, with the aim of providing every student with an equal opportunity to realise their academic potential. Mentoring can be accessed by students for a number of conditions, such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and psychosis.</p>

                <p>If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to get in touch with the Disability Advisory Service, who can be contacted at  <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x64;&#x69;&#x73;&#x61;&#98;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x69;&#116;&#x79;&#x40;&#97;&#100;&#109;&#105;&#x6e;&#46;&#x6f;&#120;&#46;&#x61;&#99;&#46;&#x75;&#107;">&#x64;&#105;&#115;&#x61;&#x62;&#x69;&#108;&#105;&#x74;&#121;&#64;&#97;&#x64;&#x6d;&#x69;&#x6e;&#46;&#x6f;&#x78;&#46;&#x61;&#99;&#46;&#x75;&#107;</a>.</p>

                <h4>Nightline</h4>

                <p><a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~nightln">http://users.ox.ac.uk/~nightln</a></p>

                <p>Listening, support and information, for students, by students, throughout the night.<br/>
                You can phone us on (2)70270 any time from 8pm to 8am. We are open from Sunday 0th week until Saturday 10th week - i.e., university term, and a week on either side. If you're ringing from an Oxford (01865) number or a mobile, then we can phone you back if you want.<br/>
                Alternatively you can come down to the office at 16 Wellington Square to talk over coffee and biscuits for as long as you like. Our phone number is internal, so you can phone us for free from any University phone (just drop the (2) from the number). Please be aware that unfortunately we do not have disabled access to the office, but please feel free to contact us via phone or Skype.</p>

                <h4>Oxford University Peer Support</h4>

                <p><a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/students/shw/peer/#d.en.30715">http://www.ox.ac.uk/students/shw/peer/#d.en.30715</a></p>

                <p>Peer Supporters are undergraduate and graduate students of the University who have received training to enable them to listen effectively, communicate sensitively, maintain confidentiality, respect boundaries and recognise when and how to encourage referral to professional support services. Peer Support offers an easily accessible and relatively informal opportunity to talk through issues which may be concerning you. Often it can help simply to get things off your chest or to know that someone is genuinely willing to listen and take time to understand what’s on your mind. Sometimes just talking things through is enough; sometimes it may lead you to seek more professional help.</p>

                <p>Peer Supporters are college based and contact details can be found by emailing Welfare Representatives or on posters around colleges. Be aware that whilst most do, not all colleges have a Peer Support programme running.</p>

                <h4>Oxford University Student Advice Service</h4>

                <p>If you need any information about the different services around Oxford, or you aren’t sure which path is right for you to take, you can always contact the Student Advice Service. If your situation leads you to consider taking time off from your studies, or suspending status, the Student Advice Service can help out.</p>

                <p>For advice and information, or to book an appointment with a student advisor, please email <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#97;&#x64;&#x76;&#x69;&#x63;&#101;&#x40;&#111;&#117;&#x73;&#117;&#x2e;&#x6f;&#x72;&#103;">&#x61;&#x64;&#x76;&#105;&#99;&#x65;&#64;&#x6f;&#117;&#x73;&#x75;&#x2e;&#111;&#x72;&#103;</a>.</p>

Each session has a suggested discussion topic, such as settling into university or talking to friends, but you are very welcome to bring along any topic of your own which you would like to discuss. There is no need to sign up, just drop by and say hello!

We connect those feeling alienated with a diverse group of volunteers, many of whom know for themselves how damaging loneliness can be.</p>
