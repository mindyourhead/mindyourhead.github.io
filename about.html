                        <p class="lead">
                            Mind Your Head is an Oxford University based organisation which aims to raise awareness and reduce the stigma of mental health issues. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One in four people will have mental health problems at some point in their lives. Yet, according to a Time to Change survey, 60% of those surveyed who suffer from a mental health condition say that the stigma surrounding their condition is as bad as, or worse than, the condition <a href="http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/news-media/time-to-change-in-the-media">itself</a>. As a society, we are largely silent about mental health, associating it with weakness, unpredictability or danger.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Mind Your Head is designed to get people thinking and talking about mental health and wellbeing. Even in a progressive community like Oxford, mental health is an awkward and poorly-understood subject, but there is no reason that it should be like that. We want to create a more welcoming culture for people who have experienced mental health problems, to spread the word about what ‘mental illness’ really means, and to encourage every student to look after their mental wellbeing.
                        </p>

                            The Mind Your Head Campaign is split into four working groups.

                        <h3>
                            It Gets Brighter
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            The It Gets Brighter Project collects and publishes short video testimonials documenting experiences of mental illness.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By bringing people face to face with others who have experienced mental illness, the It Gets Brighter Project aims to combat the stigma surrounding the issue. Of course, there is no one solution to reducing mental illness stigmatisation. But if we change the way all of us think about mental illness, it will get brighter.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The project is set to launch early this year, so check back here details or refer to <a href="http://www.itgetsbrighter.org" target="_blank">It Gets Brighter</a>

                            College Liaison
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            The College Liaison team should be the first port of call for any student or welfare team wanting to improve the mental health awareness at their college. We can provide a guide on how to organise and run a mental health awareness event at your college, as well as provide speakers and resources. This year, we are aiming to start a dialogue with Welfare Reps, JCR/MCR Presidents, and Welfare Deans in order to collate information on how each college currently deals with mental health issues. This will be with an aim to report back on what’s working, what could be done better, and providing an overall view on the current state of mental health provisions at Oxford.

                            University-Wide Campaign
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            The University-wide Awareness Working Group aims to make mental health as significant to public discussion as it is to the private lives of many of Oxford’s students. Oxford is no exception to the nationwide, if not global, trait of silence on the topic of mental health, and we aim to penetrate this culture with highly visible events and initiatives across the university.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Our work will complement that of the college liaison and online media groups, and therefore as well as encouraging conversation about mental health at Oxford, we hope to increase the reach of Mind Your Head’s online resources and college-based events by boosting the organisation’s profile as a whole.
                        </p>

                            The Online Media Presence working group consists of people interested in journalism, social media, design and web development. We write for the blog, contribute articles to the newspapers around Oxford, run the website and are in charge of Mind Your Head’s social media presence. We are currently working on a Mind Your Head journal.

                                        Hello, I'm Joshua Chauvin, a DPhil student in Experimental Psychology at New College, and I chair the Mind Your Head campaign alongside Sophie. I have a longstanding commitment to mental health issues and to de-stimatization and awareness efforts. Before I became an executive member of Mind Your Head Oxford in 2012, I worked as a research consultant at the Canadian Mental Health Association, and have created two short documentaries combatting stigmatization surrounding mental illness as well as HIV/AIDS. Even with a long history in working with and leading student organizations, I’ve never been prouder or more inspired than I have been working with the people who populate this page — and those that have gone unmentioned. Without their passion and commitment, this website as well as the many events that we put on would not be possible.

I became involved with Mind Your Head because I was appalled by the disparity between the significant number of students affected by mental health issues and the absence of helpful discussion about it; too many individuals suffer in silence because they don't know who to talk to or how to access help. I'm excited therefore to be working with a team of individuals who are so dedicated to increasing awareness and to reducing stigma around mental health issues so that Oxford students can gain more support for themselves and their friends in this vital area of health.

                                        Hello, I’m James, and I run the Online Media Presence group. I’m a third year undergraduate engineer studying at Trinity College. Outside of Mind Your Head I work with OxMak, an international development collaboration between Oxford University and Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda.
