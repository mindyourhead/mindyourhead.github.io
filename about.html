                        <p class="lead">
                            Mind Your Head is an Oxford University based organisation which aims to raise awareness and reduce the stigma of mental health issues. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One in four people will have mental health problems at some point in their lives. Yet, according to a Time to Change survey, 60% of those surveyed who suffer from a mental health condition say that the stigma surrounding their condition is as bad as, or worse than, the condition <a href="http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/news-media/time-to-change-in-the-media">itself</a>. As a society, we are largely silent about mental health, associating it with weakness, unpredictability or danger.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Mind Your Head is designed to get people thinking and talking about mental health and wellbeing. Even in a progressive community like Oxford, mental health is an awkward and poorly-understood subject, but there is no reason that it should be like that. We want to create a more welcoming culture for people who have experienced mental health problems, to spread the word about what ‘mental illness’ really means, and to encourage every student to look after their mental wellbeing.

                                        Hello, I'm Joshua Chauvin, a DPhil student in Experimental Psychology at New College, and I chair the Mind Your Head campaign alongside Sophie. I have a longstanding commitment to mental health issues and to de-stigmatization and awareness efforts. Before I became an executive member of Mind Your Head Oxford in 2012, I worked as a research consultant at the Canadian Mental Health Association, and have created two short documentaries combatting stigmatization surrounding mental illness as well as HIV/AIDS. Even with a long history in working with and leading student organizations, I’ve never been prouder or more inspired than I have been working with the people who populate this page — and those that have gone unmentioned. Without their passion and commitment, this website as well as the many events that we put on would not be possible.

I became involved with Mind Your Head because I was appalled by the disparity between the significant number of students affected by mental health issues and the absence of helpful discussion about it; too many individuals suffer in silence because they don't know who to talk to or how to access help. I'm excited therefore to be working with a team of individuals who are so dedicated to increasing awareness and to reducing stigma around mental health issues so that Oxford students can gain more support for themselves and their friends in this vital area of health.

										Hi, I’m Sam Newhouse, a 3rd year PPE undergraduate at Corpus Christi College and co-leader of the University-Wide Awareness working group. My experiences as a former welfare officer, as a friend, and personally have left upon me a grave impression of the stigma surrounding mental health issues, and a deep determination to lift the silence that causes it. Outside of Mind Your Head, I am captain of the Corpus Christi 2nds football team, and an enthusiastic member of the cricket team.

                                      Hi, I’m Jamie and I co-lead the University Awareness working group with Sam. I’m a second-year PPE student and joined the campaign at the start of this year. It’s been amazing to see it develop so quickly! Outside of MYH, I am President of the Lincoln College Vacation Project, which takes disadvantaged young children on holiday for a week, and a prolifically poor college footballer.

I'm a first year DPhil student studying Clinical Neuroscience, working to understand the brain basis for vulnerability to anxiety disorders. I am also on the Logistics committee for the upcoming Global Scholars Symposium. I love 'working and playing' with so many incredible people!
